# Commander

A Fusion 360 Addin to add varius features that I was missing while working with the programm 


## Usage

I love hotkeys and I was missing some short cuts to perform certain repeating actions, like show all bodies 
and components or adjust the camera. So, press `s` and search for the action.

### Camera

Press `s` on the keyboard an type `Camera`. 

### Show/Hode

Press `s` on the keyboard an type `Show` or `Hide`.
Show and hide will show or hide every nested component and body from the current selected component.
Show all and hide all will perform the same on the root component.
